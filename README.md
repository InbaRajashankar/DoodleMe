# DoodleMe
A command-line program that spits out procedurally-generated doodle prompts, and a timer.

## Overview
DoodleMe is a simple program to help come up with doodle ideas. There are a few modes
- Option 1 (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET): Generate a set-number of random doodle prompts.
- Option 2: A "game" that gives you a random prompt, setting a timer for you (and whoever else) to actually draw it!

## Usage
Pretty basic. Copy the repo and run `make` in your terminal, `./doodleme` will start the program.
